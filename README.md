Monkey is an interpreted language written in Go. *This project is still under development.*

## Dependencies

+ `direnv`
+ `just` (not necessary)
+ Go 1.21+
+ ginkgo (if you want to run local unit tests)
+ golangci-lint (if you want to do local lint)

## Features

+ Programs can run in REPL or as scripts
+ Identifiers consist of alphabet letters or underscore
+ Statements are explicitly end by seminlon `;`
+ Comments start with double slash `//`
+ Syntax errors are caught in a single run
+ Conditional statements (`if` and `switch` keywords)
+ Loops (`for` and `while` keywords)
+ First-class functions
+ If expressions
+ Prefix operators (binary expressions)
+ Infix operators (unary expressions)
+ Postfix operators

## Components

+ Token set
+ Lexer
+ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
+ Pratt parser based on context-free grammars and the Backus-Naur-Form
